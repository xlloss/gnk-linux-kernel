* Renesas Multi-Function Timer Pulse Unit 3 (MTU3)

The MTU3 is a multi-purpose, multi-channel timer/counter with configurable
clock inputs and programmable compare match.

Channels share hardware resources but their counter and compare match value
are independent. The MTU3 hardware supports nine channels indexed from 0 to 8.

Required Properties:

 - compatible: must be one or more of the following:
   - "renesas,mtu3" for MTU3 in common Renesas SoC.

 - reg: base address and length of the registers block for the timer module.

 - interrupts: interrupt specifiers for the timer, one for each entry in
   interrupt-names.

 - interrupt-names: must contain one entry named "tgiXY" where "X" is timer
   channels and "Y" is the channel's interrupt sources.

 - clocks: a list of phandle + clock-specifier pairs, one for each entry
   in clock-names.

 - clock-names: must contain "fck" for the functional clock.

Optional properties:

 - pwm_mode1: Assign pwm mode1 for each timer channel with its output pin
   and expose pwm controller through sysfs. Format is:

   pwm_mode1 = <channel output>, ..;

   Where:
	- channel is number of timer channels outputing pwm signals in pwm mode 1.
	  Channels which support pwm mode 1 are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7.
	- output is number of output pins. output = 0 use MTIOCA, output = 1 use MTIOCC.

 - pwm_complementary: Assign complementary pwm for each timer channel with its output pin
   and expose pwm controller through sysfs. Format is:

   pwm_complementary = <channel output deadtime>, ..;

   Where:
	- channel is number of timer channels outputing complementary pwm. Channels which
	  support complementary pwm are 3, 4, 6, 7.
	- output is number of output pins. output = 0 exports complementary pwm in
	  MTIOCA and MTIOCC pins, output = 1 use MTIOCB and MTIOCD.
	- deadtime is the time when 2 pwm signals have a same level in a cycles. The unit
	  of deadtime is nanoseconds.

Example 1: Add configuration for MTU3 of R9A07G044L2 (RZ/G2L) SoC.

	mtu3: timer@10001200 {
		compatible = "renesas,rzg2l-mtu3";
		reg = <0 0x10001200 0 0xB00>;
		interrupts =
			<GIC_SPI 170 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		interrupt-names = "tgi0a";
		clocks = <&cpg CPG_MOD R9A07G044L_CLK_MTU>;
		clock-names = "fck";
	};

Example 2: Add optional properties for pwm_mode1 and pwm_complementary of MTU3.

	&mtu3 {
		pinctrl-0 = <&mtu2_pins>, <&mtu3_pins>, <&mtu7_pins>;
		pinctrl-names = "default";
		pwm_mode1 = <2 0>;
		pwm_complementary = <3 1 100000>, <7 0 50000>;
		status = "okay";
	};
